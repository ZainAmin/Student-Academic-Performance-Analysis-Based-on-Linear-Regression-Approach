# Student Academic Performance Analysis Based on Linear Regression Approach
In this notebook we will explore the linear regression model for learning predictive modeling. Linear Regression is a very simple machine learning algorithm for finding the relationship between two continuous variables. In this repository we have determined the linear relationship between the numbers of hours a student studies and the percentage of marks that student scores in an exam.

# Dependencies

Everything is implemented in the Jupyter notebook which will hopefully make it easier to understand the code.

1) Numpy
2) Pandas
3) Matplotlib
